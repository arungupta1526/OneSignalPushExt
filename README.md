#### 🚧 **Status:** Work in Progress

I've been working on integrating OneSignal push notifications into MIT App Inventor 2. The extension includes multiple dependencies added for testing and experimentation. Despite several attempts, I haven't been able to achieve a successful build yet.

🔧 If you're familiar with extension development or dependency resolution, your help would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request with a working build. Let's make this extension stable and usable for the community!

📬 Open to collaboration, suggestions, and improvements.
