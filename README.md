# OneSignalPush Extension

**Platform:** MIT App Inventor 2  
**Created by:** Arun Gupta  
**Compiled by:** [FAST](https://community.appinventor.mit.edu/t/fast-an-efficient-way-to-build-publish-extensions/129103?u=jewel) <small><mark>v4.2.1</mark></small>

ðŸš§ **Status:** Work in Progress

I've been working on integrating OneSignal push notifications into MIT App Inventor 2. The extension includes multiple dependencies added for testing and experimentation. Despite several attempts, I haven't been able to achieve a successful build yet.

ðŸ”§ If you're familiar with extension development or dependency resolution, your help would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request with a working build. Let's make this extension stable and usable for the community!

ðŸ“¬ Open to collaboration, suggestions, and improvements.
